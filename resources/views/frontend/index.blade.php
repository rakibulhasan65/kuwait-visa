                    The <a href="https://www.manpower.gov.kw"> Public Authority of Manpower </a> (PAM) enters Employment
                    Visa information onto this site based on
                    instructions from the MOI and the <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.kw"> Ministry of Foreign Affairs </a>
                    (MOFA). Employment Visa holders can access
                    updates and download copies of their Employment Visas here, as well as verify the visa's accuracy after
                    issuance. While all types of visas in Kuwait are issued by the <a href="https://www.moi.gov.kw">
                        Ministry of Interior </a> (MOI), previously,
                    there was no automatic online download facility for Employment Visas. Typically, these visas had to be
                    collected from the MOI's Visa Centre by the company's Public Relations Officer (PRO), the sponsor, or
                    their authorized representative.

                    and the <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.kw"> Ministry of Foreign Affairs </a> (MOFA) jointly instructed
                    the <a href="https://www.manpower.gov.kw"> Public Authority of Manpower </a> (PAM) to expand its
                    responsibilities. In addition to granting visa approvals, PAM is now tasked with enabling visa holders
                    to download copies of their Employment Visas online. This new process allows visa holders to fill in the
                    required information and upload copies of necessary documents for all types of Employment Visas after
                    verification. Consequently, as of 18 March 2025, Employment Visa holders can download their visas issued
                    by the <a href="https://www.moi.gov.kw"> Ministry of Interior </a> (MOI), Kuwait, by submitting the
